# Brazilian B2B Market & ROI Optimization Rules - Nellia Prospector

## 🇧🇷 Brazilian Business Culture Context

### Communication Patterns (CRITICAL for Persona & Message Agents)
```python
BRAZILIAN_BUSINESS_CULTURE = {
    "relationship_focus": "high",  # Relationships come before business
    "hierarchy_importance": "high",  # Respect for titles and seniority
    "formality_level": "medium_to_high",  # Professional but warm
    "decision_making": "consultative",  # Often involves multiple stakeholders
    "trust_building": "essential",  # Must establish credibility first
    "personal_connection": "important"  # Mix personal and professional
}
```

### Language Considerations
- **Portuguese vs English**: Default to Portuguese context, but acknowledge many executives speak English
- **Formal address**: Use "Senhor/Senhora" initially, transition to first names after rapport
- **Regional variations**: São Paulo (business-focused), Rio (relationship-focused), regional differences
- **Technical vs Business language**: Match complexity to persona's role

## 🎯 527% ROI Optimization Strategies

### Core ROI Principles (MANDATORY for ALL agents)
1. **Quality over Quantity**: Better 10 highly personalized messages than 100 generic ones
2. **Relevance Scoring**: Only process leads with >0.7 relevance score
3. **Pain Point Mapping**: Every message must address specific, identified pain points
4. **Value Proposition Matching**: Connect Nellia's USPs to prospect's actual needs
5. **Cultural Alignment**: Messages must feel locally relevant, not translated

### ROI Metrics Framework
```python
ROI_OPTIMIZATION_TARGETS = {
    "lead_qualification_accuracy": 0.85,  # 85% of processed leads should be qualified
    "personalization_score": 0.8,        # 80% personalization elements per message
    "cultural_relevance": 0.9,           # 90% cultural appropriateness score
    "pain_point_match": 0.75,            # 75% of identified pain points addressed
    "response_rate_target": 0.15,        # 15% response rate goal
    "conversion_rate_target": 0.05       # 5% conversion rate goal

4. **Respect Hierarchy**: Address appropriate decision-making level
