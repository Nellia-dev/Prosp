# CRMBoard Component Description

This file (`src/components/CRMBoard.tsx`) defines the `CRMBoard` React component. This component implements a Kanban-style board for visualizing and managing leads as they progress through different processing stages.

Key features:
- Displays leads grouped by their processing stage (Intake, Analysis, Persona, Strategy, Message, Completed).
- Allows drag-and-drop functionality to move leads between stages.
- Includes filtering options based on search term, sector, qualification tier, and score range.
- Shows summary statistics for each processing stage (count, average ROI potential, high potential leads).
- Uses the `useTranslation` hook for internationalization.
- Integrates `CompactLeadCard` for displaying leads in the columns and `LeadDetailsModal` for viewing/editing lead details.
