# Internationalization (i18n) Description

This file (`src/i18n/translations.ts`) is central to the application's internationalization strategy. it exports the `translations` object, which holds all the translatable strings organized by language codes (e.g., `pt`, `en`, `es`), and the `Language` type, which represents the valid language keys.

Key features:
- Contains nested objects where keys represent translation keys used throughout the application and values are the translated strings.
- Defines the `Language` type as a union of the available language keys in the `translations` object.
- Used by the `useTranslation` hook (`src/hooks/useTranslation.tsx`) to provide translated strings based on the currently selected language.
