# useTranslation Hook Description

This file (`src/hooks/useTranslation.tsx`) contains a React hook for handling internationalization (i18n) within the application. It provides a context-based approach to manage the current language and access translation strings.

Key features:
- `TranslationProvider`: A context provider component that wraps the application (or parts of it) to make translation functionalities available to descendant components.
- `useTranslation`: A custom hook to access the current language, a function to set the language, and a translation function `t`.
- The `t` function takes a key (potentially dot-separated for nested translations) and returns the corresponding string for the current language, falling back to the key if the translation is not found.
